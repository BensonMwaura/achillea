<h1 align="center">🌐 Opinionated Sapper project base</h1>

## ❓ What is this?
The site that builds from this repository can be found [here](https://fir-sapper-tailwindcss.web.app/).

This is an extremely opinionated Sapper project base intended for my own use. That being said, there is quite a bit of work put into it to make it generalized and adaptable to your own setup, given that you want to use *most* of these things. The lower something is on this list, the easier it is to reconfigure or remove:

This template comes from combining two of my smaller ones: [one for Tailwind CSS (PostCSS)](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-postcss-template), and [another for TypeScript and GraphQL](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-typescript-graphql-template). If this is too much for you, check out one of those!

## 📋 Copy

Choose either to clone or fork depending on your preference.

### 🐑 Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-firebase-typescript-graphql-tailwindcss-actions-template
```

### 🍴 Fork

Click the `Use this template` button on [this project's GitHub page](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-firebase-typescript-graphql-tailwindcss-actions-template).

### ⬇️ Install Dependencies
You need to be using version 12 or higher of Node; the `package.json` `engines` field only specifies `10` for Cloud Functions for Firebase.

```sh
cd sapper-firebase-typescript-graphql-tailwindcss-actions-template
npm install  # pnpm also works
```

## 🛠 Usage

### 🧪 Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### 🔥 Deployment to Firebase
This will create a production build for you before deploying.
```sh
npm run deploy
```

### 🔨 Testing Production Builds Locally
This probably pairs well with [Firebase Emulators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/emulator-setup).
```sh
npm run prod
npm run start
```

### 📦 Deploying a Static Site to Firebase Hosting
Cloud Functions for Firebase [requires billing set up with the Blaze Plan](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15), but you can stay on the Spark Plan for a free and fast (no cold starts!) static site:
```sh
npm run deploy:export
```

This will create an exported build for you before deploying.

If your project is transitioning from SSR to a static site, be sure to delete the residual `ssr` Cloud Function:

```sh
npm run firebase functions:delete ssr
```

You will also need to remove `rewrites` from `firebase.json`.

## ⚙ Configuration

### 🔥 Firebase and 🐙 GitHub Actions
The least you should need to do to get started is to edit `.firebaserc`, changing the project ID to *your* project (initialized in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)) ID.

For automatic building and deployment to work, you need to generate [a CI login token from Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#cli-ci-systems):
```sh
npm run firebase login:ci
```
Then, go to your repository's Settings > Secrets. Copy the result of the command above and save it as a Secret named `FIREBASE_TOKEN`.

You can test if it's working by making a commit to `main` or `master` and checking the Actions tab of your repository to see if your project successfully builds and deploys to Firebase.

### ⚡ Web app
Many of the fields in `static/manifest.json` (`short_name`, `name`, `description`, `categories`, `theme_color`, and `background_color`) are filled with demonstrative values that won't match your site. Similarly, you've got to take new screenshots to replace the included `static/screenshot-1.png` and `static/screenshot-2.png` files. If you want, you can add [app shortcut definitions for "add to home screen" on Android](https://web.dev/app-shortcuts/#define-app-shortcuts-in-the-web-app-manifest). Once you change `theme_color`, update the `meta name="theme-color"` tag in `src/template.html` to match.

The [Apple touch icon](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html), favicon, and `logo-` files (also all in the `static` directory) are created by placing the logo within a "safe area" centered circle that takes up 80% of the canvas's dimension. For instance, the constraining circle in `logo-512.png` is 512 × 0.80 = 409.6 ≈ 410 pixels wide and tall. 

### 🗺 Source maps
This project base comes with [source maps](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-source-maps) enabled during development and disabled during production for the best compromise between performance and developer experience. You can change this behavior through the `sourcemap` variable in `rollup.config.js`.

### 💨 Optionally removing Tailwind CSS (and PurgeCSS)

1. Remove all Tailwind imports in the `src/global.pcss` file
2. Remove these lines in `postcss.config.js`:
    1. ```js
       const tailwindcss = require("tailwindcss");
       ```
    3. ```js
       const tailwindcssConfig = require("./tailwind.config");
       ```
    3. ```js
       tailwindcss(tailwindcssConfig),
       ```
3. Delete the `tailwind.config.js` file
4. Uninstall the `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/ui` packages

### 🕸 Optionally removing the GraphQL server
1. Remove these lines in `src/server.ts`:
    1. ```ts
       import { createApolloServer } from "./graphql";
       ```
    2. ```ts
       const apolloServer = await createApolloServer();
       ```
    3. ```ts
       apolloServer.applyMiddleware({ app, path: graphqlPath });
       ```

2. Remove the now-useless `graphqlPath` parameter to `createSapperAndApolloServer` in `src/server.ts`. This is also a good opportunity to rename the function since there is no longer an Apollo Server; if you do rename it, then also update the reference in `/index.js` or your Cloud Functions will still be referring to the old (now non-existent) function

3. Delete the `src/graphql` folder

4. Uninstall the `apollo-server-express`, `bufferutil`, `class-validator`, `graphql`, `reflect-metadata`, `type-graphql`, and `utf-8-validate` packages

5. Remove the now-error-causing
   ```yaml
   - name: "Delete the Unexportable GraphQL Page"
     run: "rm __sapper__/export/graphql"
   ```
   task in `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`

## 😵 Help! I have a question

## 😡 Fix! There is something that needs improvement

[Create an issue](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-typescript-graphql-template/issues/new) or [pull request](https://github.com/babichjacob/sapper-typescript-graphql-template/pulls) and I'll try to fix.

I'm sorry, because of my skill level and the fragility of (the combination of) some of these tools, there are likely to be problems in this project. Thank you for bringing them to my attention or fixing them for me.
